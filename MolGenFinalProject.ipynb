        "For my final project, I want to explore how deep learning models, traditionally thought to require massive datasets, can be adapted to small biological datasets through techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and regularization. I want to tailor this towards creating a modelor distinguishing between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using supervised learning techniques. I will first expand the effective size of the training set through biologically-informed data augmentation and pretraining strategies, and then develop a compact deep learning model (e.g., a small dense network or a Siamese network) optimized for generalization with minimal data. Rather than focusing on trying to maximize classification accuracy by using a very computationally intensive and complicated model architecture, I want to focus on computational efficiency and interpretability, since that is critical for practical applications in molecular genetics. On a personal level,  building computationally efficient and interpretable models is something I am passionate about and have experience with."
